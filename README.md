# NEKOS - OpenCV Prototype
A computer vision prototype with OpenCV for high school robotics
and FIRST Tech Challenge. This prototype was made for Team #6302
in the Rover Ruckus season.

## This prototype is archived
I worked on this prototype in high school for robotics club. My
intention was to experiment with OpenCV to detect "minerals" for
FIRST Tech Challenge 2018-2019 Rover Ruckus. I never got the prototype
to work reliably for detecting "minerals", so I ended up using Vuforia,
which was provided by FIRST.

Despite the prototype not being used, I learned a bit about computer
vision and image processing. I will say that the prototype was an
interesting experiment on computer vision and how it may be applied 
to robotics.

## Requirements
* opencv-python
* numpy
* matplotlib
