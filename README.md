# NEKOS - OpenCV Prototype
**Reason for archive: The repo was made for my high school robotics during my senior year. I was working with OpenCV and learning how OpenCV works. At the end, I didn't use OpenCV for the robot, but I did learned a few things about image processing. I don't plan to add anything to this repo, but I leave this repo up as archived.**
